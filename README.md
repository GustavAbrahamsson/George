# George the Hexapod

A hexapod designed, built and programmed completely from scratch.

- His name is George.
- 18 servoes
- Arduino Nano
- Li-Ion batteries
- Wirelessly controllable by *Transmitter-1*

Future improvements:
- Enhanced and smoother gait algorithm
- Better controller (Transmitter-1)
- Adapted for higher currents (too much smoke has come from George)
- Bigger and more flexible feet to dampen shocks when walking fast

WIP:
- Something to cover up all the electronics
